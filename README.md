# PeeWeeDivision
A simulator of a PeeWee division being in a professional football league

(I am not the NFL, I do not work for the NFL, I am not associated with the NFL. The NFL owns the names of the teams/divisions/ etc. mentioned in this program, but as I'm not making any money off of this program and can make absolutely zero impact on their audience with this program, I believe this falls under fair use.)

Basically, what this program simulates is if a division in the NFL was replaced with a division of kids playing football, what the season and postseason would look like.
This is an interesting question because it can show some ridiculous facts about the setup of the playoff selection, and perhaps the NFL draft as well (if this program gets that far). 
Essentially, though, our NFC-PeeWee will be competitive within its ranks (NFCPW vs NFCPW can approximately be decided by a coin flip), and the rest of the league will be assumed to be competitive, but any game between an NFCPW team and a non-NFCPW team will be completely one-sided.

# Plan of action
First, essentially we'll set up classes and functions to have teams, divisions, decide who's going to face whom, and decide who wins a game.
As mentioned, any game between a NFCPW team and a team outside that division will be lost by the NFCPW team; to start, any other game will be decided by a coin toss.
Hopefully we can set up a full schedule of games and allow for finding win-loss records across a 16-game season for each team, finding who is going to the playoffs at the end. A simulation of the postseason will be able to give us a full draft order for the next season.

After we have the basic program working, we can adjust different parts to incorporate additional information or to improve the simulation. Allowing for more input from the user-side to adjust the season simulation will also be something to start with after the basic program is in place.

# But why

Really, this is just a program I want to make to be able to play with different "edge-case" ideas on the structure of the NFL and how it works. The "PeeWee Division" case is just the first I decided to play with. Eventually, this program could be adapted to answer such questions as "How many sub-.500 teams could get into the playoffs?", "Does the draft make the league more competitive over time?", as well as playing with different thought experiments/'what-if' scenarios.
